<!-- Your task is to generate documentation for a RESTful API systematically, focusing on one endpoint at a time. The documentation for each endpoint should be comprehensive, providing essential information in a structured manner.

For each endpoint, follow this format:

Endpoint Name: Clearly state the name of the endpoint.
Request Method and URL: Specify the HTTP request method and the endpoint URL side by side.
Description: Provide a concise, single-line description of the endpoint, elucidating its primary purpose and functionality.
Request Body (if POST): If the request method is POST, outline the expected request body, including the required fields and their types.
Returns: Clearly describe what the endpoint returns, highlighting any significant information about the response.
Example Request: Present an example of a valid request to the endpoint, showcasing the necessary parameters and their values.
Example Response: Provide an example of a typical response from the endpoint, illustrating the structure and content.
Ensure that the documentation is clear, consistent, and adheres to best practices. Maintain a logical order for presenting information, making it easy for developers to understand and implement.

When generating the documentation, consider the nuances of POST requests, making explicit any required fields in the request body. Additionally, emphasize the importance of the response structure by including a representative example.

Conclude your documentation generation with a clear statement indicating the completion of documentation for the given endpoint. -->


Your task involves generating documentation for each endpoint of an API, focusing on a one-endpoint-at-a-time approach. The documentation for each endpoint should be comprehensive, providing key details in a structured format. 

For each endpoint:

1. **Name of the Endpoint:**
   Clearly specify the name of the endpoint.

2. **Request Method and Endpoint URL:**
   Present the HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST) and the endpoint URL in a concise and easily readable format.

3. **Single Line Description:**
   Provide a brief, one-line description of the endpoint's purpose and functionality.

4. **Request Body (if applicable):**
   If the endpoint involves a POST request, detail the required fields in the request body.

5. **Returns:**
   Clarify what the endpoint returns, whether it's data, status codes, or other relevant information.

6. **Example Request and Response:**
   If applicable, include an example request and response. Format these within a clear black box or another visually distinct container for easy identification.

Here is a template to guide your documentation generation:

```plaintext
**[Endpoint Name]**

**[HTTP Method] [Endpoint URL]** 

[One-line description]

**Request Body (if POST):** 
    [Field Name] [*required -if the field is required]
    [Field Description].

    [Field Name 2] [*required -if the field is required]
    [Field Description 2].

**Returns:** [Description of what the endpoint returns]

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "exampleField1": "exampleValue1",
  "exampleField2": "exampleValue2",
  ...
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "responseField1": "responseValue1",
  "responseField2": "responseValue2",
  ...
}
```
```
One endpoint will be generated at a time, the function name, method, Endpoint URL, the function code will be passed to you to generate the documentation for each endpoint.
Ensure that the documentation is clear, consistent, and adheres to best practices. Maintain a logical order for presenting information, making it easy for developers to understand and implement. When generating the documentation, consider the nuances of POST requests, making explicit any required fields in the request body. Additionally, emphasize the importance of the response structure by including a representative example. Conclude each documentation entry with a clear indication that the documentation for that specific endpoint is complete.
