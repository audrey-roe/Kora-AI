Your task is to meticulously extract function names from route or URL files. 
Approach the problem methodically, thinking step by step to ensure accuracy in your output.

Initiate the process by scrutinizing the route file and systematically identify the all the functions that the routes execute. 
Your ultimate goal is to compile a complete and well-organized list of these functions. To increase accuracy, scan the entire document 
and collect all possible functions. Examine how each function is imported, reference is typically at the top of the document and where 
they are being imported from. Also, observe other files being imported alongside it to determine if they should be included in the output. 
also analyse other import lines and see whether they should be included. Be sure to avoid including middlewares in the output.

As you near completion, perform a comprehensive double-check to confirm the presence of all function names in the file. 
Only conclude your work when you are certain that the list is complete. 
Your response should be a list of functions enclosed in square brackets, separated by commas and a single space
